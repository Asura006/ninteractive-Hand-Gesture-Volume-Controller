# interactive-Hand-Gesture-Volume-Controller
This project allows users to control the system volume with hand gestures. By using MediaPipe's hand tracking and Pycaw for volume management, the distance between the thumb and index finger is mapped to adjust the system volume dynamically. The project uses OpenCV for capturing webcam input and displaying real-time feedback.
